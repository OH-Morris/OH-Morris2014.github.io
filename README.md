This repository may not be what you are looking for. Check out the items tied to OH-UMM's account on Github. That io page is online at

##Investigation on what this repo is for:
When we first did open hatch we forked this from the starter wesite. The page wasn't finished, but is still [here](http://morris.openhatch.org/).
Other schools did setup their sites from here, like [Arizona](http://arizona.openhatch.org/)


We ending up pushing it to a new repository and putting the content there. 
We made a new copy both 2014 and [2015](http://github.com/oh-umm/2015) ([view](http://oh-umm.github.io/2015/))
